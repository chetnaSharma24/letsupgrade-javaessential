    In javascript, the console is an object which provides access to the browser debugging console.

   <h1> console.log()</h1>

    Mainly used to log(print) the output to the console. 
    We can put any type inside the log(), be it a string, array, object, boolean etc.
<p>  Var:-
    The JavaScript variables statement is used to declare a variable and, optionally, 
    we can initialize the value of that variable.
    sytax: var a;<br>
    let:-
    The let statement declares a local variable in a block scope. It is similar to var,
     in that we can optionally initialize the variable.
    Example: let a =10;<br>
    const:-
    const statement values can be assigned once and they cannot be reassigned. 
    The scope of const statement works similar to let statements.
    Example: const a =10;

    JavaScript has seven types. Types are values that JavaScript can have. 
    Below is a list of data types that JavaScript can have:
    <ul><li>
        Number: any integer, double,float is a number</li>
       <li>String:group of characters enclosed in double or single qotes</li>
        <li>Boolean: it gives only true or false as output</li>
        <li>Undefined:Undefined data type means a variable that is not defined. The variable is declared but doesn’t contain any value.</li>
       <li>Null:The null in JavaScript is a data type that is represented by only one value, the ‘null’ itself. A null value means no value.</li>
        <li>object:An object in JavaScript contains key-value pairs in its address. When we refer to obj1,
            we are actually referring to the address in memory which contains the value {a: 5, b: 6}, instead of the value {a: 5, b: 6} directly.
            var obj1 = { a: 5, b: 6 };
        </li>
    </ul>
