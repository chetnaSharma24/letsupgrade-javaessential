    In javascript, the console is an object which provides access to the browser debugging console.

   <h1> console.log()</h1>

    Mainly used to log(print) the output to the console. 
    We can put any type inside the log(), be it a string, array, object, boolean etc.
<p>  Var:-
    The JavaScript variables statement is used to declare a variable and, optionally, 
    we can initialize the value of that variable.
    sytax: var a;<br>
    let:-
    The let statement declares a local variable in a block scope. It is similar to var,
     in that we can optionally initialize the variable.
    Example: let a =10;<br>
    const:-
    const statement values can be assigned once and they cannot be reassigned. 
    The scope of const statement works similar to let statements.
    Example: const a =10;
